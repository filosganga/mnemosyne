# Mnemosyne

> Mnemosyne (mnɛːmosýːnɛː) is the Greek god of memory. "Mnemosyne" is derived from the same source as the word mnemonic, that being the Greek word mnēmē, which means "remembrance, memory"

This library is  responsible to deduplicate signals received from external system by remembering which one has been alredy processed.

It is based on two main concepts:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the signal
- `processorId`: The unique identifier of the system the process the signal

It is able to work across multiple node with the same `processorId`. The persistence is based on [DynamoDb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and its strong consistency write capability. The same concept can be applied to [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) or any other similar database that provides these two features:

- Strong consistency writes
- Upsert with the previous record values returned

## How to configure it

A `processorId` need to be assigned to each instance of this library. It will univoque identify the processor. If two services have the same `processorId` it likely means they are two instance of the same service.

We need to know the max amount of time the process will take (`maxProcessingTime` in the config). Any process that take more than this amount of time will be considered death.

## How does it work

It is based on the two phase commit strategy. It records when the processor starts to process a signal and when it completes it. It provides a `protect` method that wraps the effect of signal processing to guarantee that it will happen only once for each `processorId`.

The DynamoDb table has this structure:

- `id`: S - The unique identifier of the signal
- `processorId`: S - The unique identifier of the processor
- `startedAt`: N - The datetime the signal has started to be processed
- `completedAt`: N - The datetime when the signal has been completed
- `expiresOn`: N - The datetime when the signal process will expires

Each time a processor with a given `processorId` attempt to process a signal identified by `id`, it updates or writes on the table a record with `id`, `processorId`, `startedAt`. If the record with given `id` and `processorId` was already present, its value is returned to the library otherwise nothing is returned. After the process has runned successfully, the library mark it as completed by storing the `completedAt` and the `expiresOn` fields.

The `expiresOn` allows to clean up old data and re-run duplicate after some time.

When the librry attemp to start a process, these scenarios can happen:

1) The signal has never been processed previously (not previous record found)
2) The signal has been already processed previously (`completedAt` is present)
3) The signal has timeout processing (`completedAt` is absent and `startedAt` + `processingTime` is in the past)
4) The signal is stil being processing (`completedAt` is absent and `startedAt` + `processingTime` is in the future)

In cases (1) and (2) the library allow the signal to be processed. In cases (3) the library does not allow the signal to be processed again and (4) the library wait the process to either complete or timeout before taking any decision.
